These are the APK files used to add the Robot Controller and Driver Station apps to the phones.

Copy the necessary APK to the phone of your choice and install the programs through the phone's file explorer.

NOTE: Installing the Robot Controller app is unnecessary because the app is installed automatically when you push your team's OpModes to the phone through Android Studio.
